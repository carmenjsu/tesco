# Tesco model 

This project is to calcualte and visualise the most effective way for me to shop at Tesco. 

Perk Box: Each week, I purchase the vouchers first (with 4% off) then pay with it. Max £200.

Tesco CreditCard: 5 Clubcard points when I spend £4 in Tesco, 1 Clubcard point every £8 spent anywhere else. 1 Clubcard point is 1p in Tesco voucher. 

Tesco Clubcard Boost: Median is x3 of its value to exchange for something else

Amex: 1% cashback under £10,000, 1.25% over £10,000

Assumptions: 
1) 1% cashback on Amex
2) look from £1-200

The test will be:
1) Perk with Tesco Card
2) Perk with Amex
3) just Tesco Card
4) just Amex
